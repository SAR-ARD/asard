# asard test suite
This folder contains some tests to ensure processing works as intended.
The tests need some test data, which is not delivered with the software.
You can request the test data from the package maintainer [John Truckenbrodt](mailto:john.truckenbrodt@dlr.de).
The tests look up the test folder using an environment variable `ASARD_TESTDATA`.
This folder needs to contain all data and the variable needs to be set to it.
